# Megaflix - Streaming Platform

## Overview

Megaflix is a modern streaming platform application built with React and Express.js. It's designed as a Netflix-like service that provides access to movies, series, anime, cartoons, and novels in a single platform. The application features a responsive design with a dark theme and includes subscription plans, content browsing, and user testimonials.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark theme implementation
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface for future database integration
- **Session Management**: Planned with connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL sessions

### Key Components

#### Frontend Components
- **Header**: Navigation with smooth scrolling between sections
- **Hero Section**: Main landing area with call-to-action buttons
- **Trending Section**: Content carousel with modal popups for detailed views
- **Subscription Plans**: Three-tier pricing structure (Monthly, Yearly, Lifetime)
- **Benefits Section**: Feature highlights with device compatibility
- **Testimonials**: User reviews and ratings
- **Footer**: Links and final call-to-action

#### Backend Structure
- **Routes**: Centralized route registration in `server/routes.ts`
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with memory and database implementations
- **Schema**: User management with Drizzle ORM schema definitions
- **Middleware**: Request logging and error handling

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request**: User interacts with React components
2. **State Management**: React Query manages server state and caching
3. **API Calls**: Frontend makes HTTP requests to Express backend
4. **Route Handling**: Express routes process requests using storage interface
5. **Data Storage**: Storage interface abstracts database operations
6. **Response**: JSON data returned to frontend for UI updates

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components for accessibility
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React and React Icons
- **Animations**: CSS animations and transitions
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Poppins, Inter)

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with Zod schema validation
- **Session Store**: PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, esbuild for production builds

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Development server and build tool
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment optimization

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with hot module replacement
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL database
- **Environment**: Replit with Node.js 20, PostgreSQL 16 modules

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite build process generating optimized static assets (71KB CSS, 367KB JS)
- **Backend**: esbuild compilation to single JavaScript file (34KB)
- **Build Output**: `dist/public/` for frontend, `dist/index.js` for server
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless functions
- **Configuration**: Optimized `vercel.json` for full-stack deployment

### Vercel Deployment
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
- **Server Function**: `dist/index.js` with 30s timeout
- **Environment Variables**: FOR4PAYMENTS_API_KEY, UTMIFY_API_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY
- **Routing**: API routes to serverless function, static assets served directly

### Database Management
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- **Connection**: Environment-based DATABASE_URL configuration
- **Schema**: Shared schema definitions between frontend and backend
