## Overview

Megaflix is a modern streaming platform application built with React and Express.js. It's designed as a Netflix-like service that provides access to movies, series, anime, cartoons, and novels in a single platform.

- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface for future database integration
- **Session Management**: Planned with connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL sessions

### Key Components

#### Frontend Components
- **Header**: Navigation with smooth scrolling between sections
- **Hero Section**: Main landing area with call-to-action buttons
- **Trending Section**: Content carousel with modal popups for detailed views

- **Middleware**: Request logging and error handling

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request**: User interacts with React components
2. **State Management**: React Query manages server state and caching
3. **API Calls**: Frontend makes HTTP requests to Express backend
4. **Route Handling**: Express routes process requests using storage interface
5. **Data Storage**: Storage interface abstracts database operations
6. **Response**: JSON data returned to frontend for UI updates
